## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the price of a used car based on various features that influence its value. The dataset used in this project includes information about car attributes like make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and more. A machine learning regression model is trained on this data to predict the price of a car.

### Key Objectives:
- Perform **data cleaning** and **preprocessing** on the car dataset.
- Apply **feature engineering** to extract meaningful information from raw data.
- Train a **machine learning model** (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict car prices.
- Evaluate model performance using various regression metrics like R², Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates new features from raw data, such as transforming the date of manufacture into car age.
- **Model Training**: Implements various regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and more.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates models using metrics such as R², MSE, and MAE to assess prediction accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualizations to explore relationships between car features and price.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains information about used cars, including their features and prices. Key attributes in the dataset include:

- **Make**: The brand or manufacturer of the car (e.g., Toyota, Ford, Honda).
- **Model**: The specific model of the car.
- **Year**: The year the car was manufactured.
- **Mileage**: The distance the car has traveled (in kilometers).
- **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel used by the car (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, Electric).
- **Price**: The price of the car (target variable).

The data can be downloaded from sources like Kaggle or similar platforms, or it may be provided directly in the repository if available.

## Installation

To use this repository, ensure that you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. The following libraries are required:

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **matplotlib** & **seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

If you plan to work with Jupyter notebooks, you can install JupyterLab:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```

### 3. Data Preprocessing

Before training the model, the data must be preprocessed. This includes cleaning missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features. You can use the `data_preprocessing.py` script to perform this step, or follow the instructions in the notebook:

```bash
python data_preprocessing.py
```

### 4. Model Training

The repository includes scripts to train different regression models. Run the following command to train a model using Linear Regression:

```bash
python train_linear_regression.py
```

You can also try other regression models like Random Forest by running the corresponding script.

### 5. Model Evaluation

After training the model, evaluate its performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R². The evaluation can be done by running:

```bash
python evaluate_model.py
```

This will output key metrics to help you assess the model’s prediction accuracy.

### 6. Prediction

Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to predict the price of a car based on new input data. The prediction can be done using:

```bash
python predict_price.py
```

This script will take input features for a car and predict its price.

## Model Training and Evaluation

The repository includes the following machine learning models for car price prediction:

- **Linear Regression**: A simple regression model that assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning model that uses multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: A powerful algorithm for regression tasks.

The models are trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated using metrics such as:
- **R²**: The proportion of variance explained by the model.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: A measure of the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.

## Real-World Applications

Car price prediction is a common task in various industries, including:
- **E-commerce**: Online car sales platforms can use predictive models to estimate car prices.
- **Automotive Marketplaces**: Platforms like CarDekho or AutoTrader can implement price prediction tools to help users get better deals.
- **Insurance**: Car insurance companies can use price predictions to assess the value of vehicles for setting premiums.
- **Vehicle Financing**: Financial institutions can use price prediction models to offer loans and financing based on accurate car valuations.
